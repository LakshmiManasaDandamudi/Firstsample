1.create a file in your system which will have all your git working files or folders
2.go to that directory using git as
         directory related cmds:
                                 cd ~ : to change directory or folder
                                 pwd : to see present directory where you are
                                 cd .. :it takes you one directory back
3.now you need to turn folder into git project so that it keeps track of all changes you made
                            $git init
4.create a text or any other type of file in your directory folder and save it(it was saved only in your computer 
                                                                      not in repository untill you commit it in git)

add : to tell git to add all changes to your file
commit : saving the project or file to that point of time...so that you can come back anytime to that point
status : shows the status of file
pwd-to see directory
ls-to see all files or folders in present directory
log: to see all commited history
log --authot= "authorname" : to show only one particular person commited log 

workflow:

working copy stage: here we creates file and edit file and saves in local computer/machine
staging area {$git add . or $git add "filename"}:by adding we are geeting file ready to repository
commit : pushing file to repository

done for today 3/3/2020
